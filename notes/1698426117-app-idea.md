## ConnectionPoints

App on our phone, designed for a couple, friends, family

It has a challenge and reward type of setup

Users input challenges to each other (maybe to ourselves) creating a catalog of challenges

Challenges are assigned a token value by the user

The other user can accept or decline any given challenge

If you succeed, the acquired token can go towards a prize

Prizes can be user defined, with uploadable screenshot. Prizes are crafted by users into a centralized catalog.

Ex:
- Movie date (4 tokens)
- Massage (5 tokens)
- Night out at the bars (8 tokens)

Challenge Notes:
- All challenges require a time constraint, it can effectively be in the distant future or in the next 10 minutes
- Post challenge completion, the other user must accept/acknowledge the challenge as being done
- Post reward acquisition, the acquiring user must accept/acknowledge the reward as being purveyed in order for tokens to be deducted

Tokens (optionally) have an attrition rate of 1 per day
Attrition does not start, until you have N days of inactivity

You can star/favorite/rank a reward to inform the other user of what you are building towards

There should be challenges which are recurring, such as cleaning the house before bed

There are 2 types of rewards, one-time (like a trip out of town or a new specific restaurant) and regular which can be redeemed as often as you rack up the points for it. The capitalistic nature of the game should make it self balancing amongst users, yet extremely rewarding. 

It can be used to deepen friendships, strengthen bonds, or have a raucous time with friends.
