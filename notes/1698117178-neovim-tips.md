Use `:noautocmd w` to save a file without triggering any autocommands. This is useful if you have a plugin that runs a command on save that you don't want to run.

Project wide search and replace with `:cfdo`:

:grep <foo> :cfdo %s/<foo>/<bar>/gc

Or use Telescope with quickfix list:

telescope search -> quickfix -> :cdo
