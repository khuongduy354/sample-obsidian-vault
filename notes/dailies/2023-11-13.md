## AST manipulation

Metaprogramming in python is fairly trivial.

As an example, this allows us to safely import a module without executing its
imports. This means we can parse the source code of a module without having to
have all of its dependencies installed. Its not guaranteed to work due to the dynamic
nature of python, but it works well enough for a decent number of use cases. The code 
as-is is unable to manage an import symbol being used in the body of the module outside
a `__name__ == "__main__"` guard. This is common in python, but not in our use case.

```python
import ast
import copy
import sys

with open("ast_fixture.py") as f:
    tree = ast.parse(f.read())


def make_lazy_source(tree: ast.Module) -> ast.Module:
    """Takes a cdf source module and returns a lazy version of it.

    This is done by moving all imports to a function called __do_imports,
    whose invocation is deferred until the first call to the lazy source.

    We whitelist imports from cdf, dlt, and anything already imported in the
    current module. This gives use the highesy chance of parsing the source
    code body for __CDF_SOURCE__ metadata. If this fails, we can fall back to
    the original source code. This allows us to parse the source code across
    the entire project without having to worry about disparate dependencies.
    """
    mut_tree = copy.deepcopy(tree)
    import_nodes = []
    whitelist = ["cdf", "dlt", *sys.modules.keys()]
    for ix in reversed(range(len(tree.body))):
        node = mut_tree.body[ix]
        if isinstance(node, (ast.Import, ast.ImportFrom)):
            if any(alias.name in whitelist for alias in node.names):
                continue
            if isinstance(node, ast.ImportFrom):
                if node.module in whitelist:
                    continue
            import_nodes.append(mut_tree.body.pop(ix))
    imports = ";".join(ast.unparse(i) for i in import_nodes)
    defer_import_fn = ast.parse(
        f"def __do_imports(): {imports}; globals().update(locals())"
    )
    mut_tree.body = [*defer_import_fn.body, *mut_tree.body]
    return mut_tree


print(ast.unparse(make_lazy_source(tree)))


```

### Fixture

```python
import os
import sys
import time as _time
from pathlib import Path

from dlt import source

something = 1

print("OK")


def foo(x: int) -> int:
    """Add one to x."""
    return x + 1

```
