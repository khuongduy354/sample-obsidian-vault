## Monads

Monads have 3 things:

- a wrapper type
  - like Option, Future, etc
- a wrap function (return, pure, unit)
  - allows entry into Monad ecosystem, wraps a value in the monad
- a run function (bind, flatmap, >>=)
  - runs transformations on monadic values (aka the inner value)


A flatmap essentially says, given a function that returns the wrapper type, unwrap it 
and return the value inside the wrapper type. Instead of a double-wrapped value. 

Think of a list (which is a monad).

Given this function:

`f (a -> [b]): a -> [b]`

`f` returns a list of `b` values. If we `map` over our list, we get a list of lists of `b` values.
Instead, a flatmap will return a list of `b` values. It could be said that `f` takes regular old
`a` and "lifts" it into our `M[b]`. But if we already have an `M[a]`, we still want to apply
functions to it that return `M[b]` values, but we don't want to end up with a `M[M[b]]` value.
So we need to "flatten" the result of the function, hence `flatmap`.

```python
# Our Monad is list[int]
m = [1,2,3]

# `f` takes an int (regular type) and returns a list of ints (aka our monad!)
# it can be said that `f` lifts the int into our monad
def f(a: int) -> list[int]:
  return [a - 1, a, a + 1]

# But what if we map and apply `f` to our monad?
list(map(f, m))

# the result is a list of lists, aka a list[list[int]] or a "double-wrapped" monad
# that means the function is useless to us if we already have a monad... unless we flatten it!
[ [0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] ]

def flatmap(f_, m_):
  new_monad: list[int] = []
  for monad in list(map(f_, m_)):
    new_monad.extend(monad)
  return new_monad

# now we can apply the function to our monad and get a list of ints back
flatmap(f, m)

# the result is a list of ints, aka its the original monad type
[0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4]
```

I think the simplest way to think of flatmap or bind is to first think of function that operates on the wrapped
type and returns a beautiful new monad. But you want to combine (combinator) that monadic value with the already
existing monad. So you unwrap the current monad, apply the function to the inner value, unwrap the function result
and construct a new monad instance with the combined values.


A map is even easier to understand. It operates on the inside type and returns a regular type which the monad will
rewrap for you. What this does, and flatmap too, is it allows you to have business logic or side effects in the
map functions while to the user, they are simply applying transformations to the inner value similar to what they 
would be doing to the inner value if it wasn't wrapped. In fact the applicable functions are just regular functions
totally unaware of the monad context. 

A flatmap function by comparison must be aware of the monad because it returns a monad, so code-wise it is more coupled.


Using map, I can write specific code for specific types, standard stuff I would already be doing BUT I can execute it in
such a way that it is transparent to the user they are using a monad and triggering interesting side-effects.
