# nvim-tips

It never ceases to amaze me how many shortcuts and tricks there are in Neovim / Vim. 

A new one I like a lot:

`:<Ctrl>-f` to open ex mode and edit the current command in a buffer. You can also see the command history in the same
buffer. Pressing `<Enter>` in normal mode will execute the command.

This is similar to ZSH supporting editing the current command in a buffer. I use `vv` in normal mode binding to open the
current command in a buffer. The default uses an emacs binding of `C-x C-e` to open the current command in a buffer. I
like the vim-like binding better.


Current keybindings of interest

I have Git Diffview setup. We can use `<space>gdo` [g]it [d]iffview [o]pen to open the diffview for the current file. We
can use `<space>gdd` [g]it [d]iffview [d]estroy to close the diffview. We can use `<space>gdh` [g]it [d]iffview
[h]istory to look at the history of the current buffer's file. We can use `<space>gdH` [g]it [d]iffview [H]istory to
look at the repo history.

Format Wrap

You can use `gw` to wrap the current text based on the `textwidth` setting. A similar bind is `gq` but it calls
`formatexpr` to format the current text. If that value is nil then it operates the same as `gw`.

Using `<C-o` and `<C-i>` to jump back and forth between jumps is extremely useful.
