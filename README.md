# Alex Butler's Obsidian Vault

Hello! I'm Alex Butler, and this is the public repository for my Obsidian vault. Here, I share notes, knowledge snippets, and ideas curated over time. I've chosen to open up this vault to help others learn and to foster collaboration.

## About Obsidian

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking and personal knowledge management application. It utilizes Markdown for note creation and has a unique feature set, including linking between notes, backlinking, graph views, and more. If you're unfamiliar with Obsidian, you can learn more from their official [website](https://obsidian.md/).

## Navigating the Vault

- **Notes**: All individual notes are saved as .md files. You can navigate through them just as you would any other Markdown file on GitHub.
- **Attachments**: Images, documents, and other attachments can be found in the respective folders.
- **Graph View**: To get a visual representation of how the notes are interlinked, you'd need to open the vault in Obsidian and access the graph view feature.

## Contributions and Feedback

While this vault primarily serves as a personal space for my thoughts and learnings, I'm open to collaborations and contributions:

1. **Suggestions and Corrections**: If you spot any inaccuracies or have suggestions, please open an issue on this repo.
2. **Collaborative Notes**: If you're keen to expand on a topic or collaborate on a particular note, feel free to create a pull request.
